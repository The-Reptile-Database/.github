# Reptile Database Organization Description
Welcome to the Reptile Database! We are a group of developers and herpetologists who are passionate about creating and maintaining the Reptile Database, a comprehensive taxonomic database of all living reptiles.

The Reptile Database contains information on over 12,000 species and subspecies of reptiles, including turtles, snakes, lizards, crocodiles, tuataras, and amphisbaenians. For each species, the database includes information on its scientific name, common names, taxonomic classification, distribution, habitat, conservation status, and more. The database also includes a large collection of images and references.
